            "1. **Camera Types and Standards**: Digital cameras (IP-based) capable of high-resolution video recording (e.g., 1080p, 4K). These cameras must support modern image processing features such as motion detection, infra-red/night vision, wide dynamic range (WDR), weatherproof and vandal-resistant casing.\n",
            "2. **Integration and Compatibility**: Cameras must integrate with existing surveillance management systems (SMS). Compatibility with widely used video formats, open protocols (ONVIF), and third-party software is essential.\n",
            "3. **Network Communication**: Cameras should support secure networking protocols such as HTTPS encryption and be equipped with PoE (Power over Ethernet) for simplified cabling.\n",
            "4. **Storage and Retention**: Sufficient storage solutions, typically through cloud systems or local recording servers, must meet GDPR-compliant data retention policies.\n",

            "\n",
            "#### **Legal Requirements**\n",
            "1. **GDPR Compliance**: All equipment and systems must ensure protection of personal data in compliance with GDPR regulations (e.g., anonymization or encryption of recorded data).\n",
            "2. **Transparency**: Procurement procedures must be conducted fairly and transparently according to EU Public Procurement Directive (2014/24/EU), ensuring equal treatment for all bidders.\n",
            "3. **Environmental Standards**: Compliance with EU environmental and energy efficiency standards (e.g., eco-friendly materials, low power consumption technology).\n",
            "4. **Warranty and Maintenance**: Vendors must provide warranties, ongoing maintenance services, and documented commitments for spare parts availability over time.\n",
            "5. **Conflict of Interest Clauses**: Bidders must declare any conflicts of interest within their contracts to avoid integrity breaches.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Budget Constraints**: What is the allocated budget for procurement, installation, and ongoing maintenance? Should cost-efficiency in energy consumption be factored into the evaluation criteria?\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Retention and Access Policies**: Who will have access to data collected by the cameras, and what are the storage duration requirements? Are additional systems (e.g., backup servers) needed to fulfill GDPR-compliant retention standards?\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Vendor Evaluation**: What criteria should be prioritized during vendor selection (e.g., technical expertise, experience in public tender projects, eco-friendly certifications)? Should local suppliers be given preference, or is eligibility open to EU-wide bidders? \n",

            "Dublin City Council (DCC) is seeking to procure a comprehensive municipal surveillance camera system to enhance public safety, prevent crime, and improve traffic management across the city. The system will be deployed across 10 public parks, 5 key intersections, and 3 municipal buildings, with an estimated total of 60 cameras. The solution must integrate seamlessly with the city’s existing infrastructure, including 25 analogue-to-IP converted cameras and the traffic-control Variable Message Sign (VMS) system, while being scalable to accommodate up to 100 additional devices over the next five years.\n",
            "\n",
            "This procurement aligns with DCC’s commitment to ensuring public safety, data privacy, and environmental sustainability, while adhering to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements. The successful tenderer will be responsible for the supply, installation, commissioning, and maintenance of the surveillance system, as well as providing ongoing support and training for DCC personnel.\n",
